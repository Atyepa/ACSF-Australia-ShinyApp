# ACSF-Australia-ShinyApp
ShinyApp to visualise the amount of foods sold from supermarket/specialist/convenience food stores across Australia from 2018-19 to 2019-20.
The source data is the ABS Apparent Consumption of Selected Foodstuffs (ACSF) available from https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/health/health-conditions-and-risks/apparent-consumption-selected-foodstuffs-australia/2019-20

The ACSF codes all foods sold from supermarkets to the AUSNUT 2011-13 classification (see: https://github.com/Atyepa/AUSNUT). 
All published data was based on daily per capita amounts (dividing by estimated population and number of days in the period), except for gross sales (which is total tonnes per year). An explanantion of the methodology is published at https://www.abs.gov.au/methodologies/apparent-consumption-selected-foodstuffs-australia-methodology/2019-20.

This ShinyApp was designed to allow the user to interact with the available data to visualise answers to questions such as:
1) What is the total amount (weight, energy, macronutrients) of all foods and beverages sold?
2) What are the amounts of nutrients available from particular foods (e.g. AUSNUT foods such as: non-alcoholic beverages or cereal and cereal products milk, or Australian Dietary Guideline (ADG) food groups: vegetables, fruit, meats (and alternatives), dairy (and alternatives) and grains/cereals. The classification also allows recodes of foods into discretionary/non-discretionary groups, and sugar-sweetened beverages.   
3) How does food consumption change by month? This question may be somewhat overshadowed by the changes seen with the COVID-19 related sales patterns particularly in March 2020, but also April to June as households relied more on supermarkets than the food service industry.
